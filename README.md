    An example of how to use IGListKit in conjunction with PureLayout. This view controller creates a collection view and uses list kit to display diffable data.

    In this example we use IGListKit to create a diffable list view that displays two types of cell, one for a user and one for a string.
    The flexibility provided by IGListKit allows us to easily manage multiple different types of objects into one common feed.
